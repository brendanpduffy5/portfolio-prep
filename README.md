# Process Focused Developer

*Software developer and US Army Veteran with extensive project manager experience and a focused interest in automation in support of sustainability and community development.*

I previously worked as a project manager for the US Army and then worked in sales and project management.  I decided to learn Software Development because as I moved into project management, I found that the best solutions often involved two things: automation through code and high-quality visual user interfaces that make the process easy for the user.  After doing research I found that full stack development with a focus on JavaScript is a skillset that is increasingly in demand and will be able to give me the ability to create those types of solutions.  Ideally I would like to work for a company that is focused on either renewable resources or fintech.  I would like to use technology to help people measure abstract concepts that can be hard to visualize.  Between being an end user in sales and my experience as a project manager in the military, I feel that I have a unique background set that will help me create programs that are designed with the end user in mind.

The thing that most excites me about tech is that we can use automation to help improve people’s lives, whether that is on an individual level, using tools like fitness trackers to help people more easily improve their health or on a larger scale using apps to collect and help people visualize data science in order to help solve some of society’s larger problems.
